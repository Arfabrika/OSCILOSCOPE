Application for working with [virtual](#working-with-virtual-singals) and [real](#working-with-real-singals) analog signals

### Common
Application makes plots of different singal representations: amplitude and spectrum plots. Plots are accompanied by the singal formulas. Singal spectrum is calculated with Fast Fourier transform.

User can change scale of the amplitude plot by controllers similar to oscilloscope's controllers. Standard matplotlib instruments for woking with plots also supported.

### Working with virtual signals
Application can virtual signals which are created by user.

Virtual signal parameters:
- singal form (sinus, cosinus, triangle, square, sawtooth)
- amplitude (V)
- frequency (Hz)

Created singals used in other program modules

Work modes for virtual signals:
- working with single singal
- amplitude modulation
- frequency modulation
- multiple signal summation
